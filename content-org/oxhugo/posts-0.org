** Steps
- These steps work only for a new site! =thelazyuniverse.github.io= should not exist prior to the sequence of steps described here.
*** Site and Module Initialization
- Initialize the site as Hugo module
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     hugo new site thelazyuniverse.github.io
     cd thelazyuniverse.github.io
     git init .
     hugo mod init thelazyuniverse.github.io
   #+END_SRC
*** Adding the Theme module
- Add the theme as a Module
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     hugo mod get gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-theme-refined
   #+END_SRC
*** Site Configuration
- Edit the =hugo.toml= file
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
     [module]
       [[module.imports]]
         path = "gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-theme-refined"
   #+END_SRC

- Complete the rest of the =hugo.toml= configuration file editing

*** Content Creation
- Create a ~content-org~ folder
- Create the ~cae-setup.org~ in the ~content-org~ folder
- Create the ~oxhugo~ folder in the ~content-org~ folder
   - This folder will have all the posts related to =@oxhugo= category in one or more
     files. The first file in will be called =posts-0.org=. If and when this file
     gets too big, start the =post-1.org=, then =posts-2.org=, and so on.
- Create the ~images~ folder under the ~oxhugo~ folder
- Create the ~posts-0.org~ file
   - Export the contents of this file
- Create a folder (with the =images= sub-folder) for each category. Inside the category
  folder, create =org= files following the =posts-N.org= convention, with N=0 \cdots 

*** Test the site locally
- =C-c C-e H A= to export the content defined in the =posts-0.org= file.
- Run =hugo server -D= and verify everything looks correct.
- Change status of posts from =DRAFT= to =DONE=
- Follow the steps listed at [[https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#procedure][Hosting on GitHub]]
- Visit [[https://thelazyuniverse.github.io][TheLazyUniverse]] to verify the initial post looks ok.
- The blog is now setup!
